# vectorcast_gitlab

This is a submodule for the scripts required to integrate VectorCAST and various CI/CD tools

# Summary

This integration allows the user to build, execute, generate reports, and generate metrics for 
[VectorCAST](http://vector.com/vectorcast) Projects in various CI/CD tools

Results can be published in the following formats
* Coverage results to **_GitLab_**, **_SonarQube_**: **_Cobertura_** (xml_data/cobertura) and **_Extended Cobertura_**
* Test Results
    * To **_GitLab_**: **_JUnit_** (xml_data/junit)
    * To **_SonarQube_**: **_CppUnit_** (xml_data/sonarqube)  
* Static Analysis to **_GitLab_**: **_CodeClimate_** (pclp/gl-code-quality-report.json)

:warning: Due to the limiations of Cobertura plugin, only Statement and Branch results are reported

# Calling Action

The python scrip `vcast_exec.py` is the main driver for build/execute VectorCAST Projects.  You can run environments in parallel by specifying `--jobs #`

The api for vcast_exec.py follows:

```
    usage: vcast_exec.py [-h] [--build-execute] [--build | --incremental]
                         [--output_dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--html_base_dir HTML_BASE_DIR]
                         [--cobertura] [--cobertura_extended] [--junit]
                         [--sonarqube] [--pclp_input PCLP_INPUT]
                         [--exit_with_failed_count [EXIT_WITH_FAILED_COUNT]]
                         [--aggregate] [--metrics] [--fullstatus] [--jobs JOBS]
                         [--ci] [-l LEVEL] [-e ENVIRONMENT] [--gitlab | --azure]
                         [--print_exc] [--timing] [-v]
